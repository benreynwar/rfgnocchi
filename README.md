# rfgnocchi

Library of HDL signal-processing blocks for use with RFNoC.

This project is nowhere near ready for anyone to use seriously.

RFgnocchi uses the python package 'pyvivado (https://github.com/benreynwar/pyvivado)' for testing the projects.

Also since I currently don't have compatible hardware these modules will
only have been tested through simulation.

The license is MIT except for files that I've taken from elsewhere and specify otherwise.

Some of the blocks use code from the Ettus Research repository at https://github.com/ettusresearch/fpga/tree/rfnoc-devel which you'll have to clone independently and which comes under a different license.
