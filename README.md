# rfgnocchi

Library of HDL signal-processing blocks for use with RFNoC.

This project is nowhere near ready for anyone to use, and I'm only
putting it in a public github repository because I ran out of private ones.

RFgnocchi uses the python package 'pyvivado' for testing the projects.
I haven't opensourced 'pyvivado' yet.

Also since I currently don't have compatible hardware these modules will
only have been tested through simulation.

The license is GPL since to start off with a lot of the code will come from
Ettus Research, who release their code under GPL.
The goal eventually is to have mixture of signal processing blocks licensed
under the MIT and GPL licenses.
